However, if at least one person-level variable is included (e.g., \"age\"), the data will be loaded at the individual level.\nWhen selecting specific variables, note that some additional variables will be included by default. For clarity, run lissyrtools::key_vars_household_lis, lissyrtools::key_vars_person_lis, and their equivalents for LWS.\n\n\nfrom\nA numeric value representing the year (inclusive) after which the LIS/LWS datasets should be loaded.\n\n\nto\nA numeric value representing the year (inclusive) up to which the LIS/LWS datasets should be loaded.\n\n\nsubset\nA logical expression defining the criteria for subsetting the data. Observations for which the expression evaluates to TRUE are included in the subset.\n\n\nlws\nA logical value indicating whether to load LWS data. If TRUE, LWS data is loaded; otherwise (default: FALSE), LIS data is loaded instead. Note that this does not eliminate the need to set the ‘Project’ field accordingly in the LISSY remote system."
