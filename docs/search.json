If both household-level and person-level variables are specified, lissyuse() will automatically merge the two types of files. For faster and more efficient processing, we strongly recommend selecting of a restricted set of variables in vars argument. Additionally, the function includes a subset argument that allows users to limit the data to a specific subgroup.\nPlease refer to the following links on how to start with LISSY, and on LIS’s metadata information system: METIS for detailed information on our available datasets and their respective variables."

    "text": "Arguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata\nA character vector containing the datasets to be loaded.\n\nOne can select the datasets separately, using their ccyy format, e.g., data = c(\"de16\", \"it20\");\nTo select and entire series from a given country, we recommend the use of the format cc, e.g., data = c(\"us\", \"uk\");\nThese two formats can also be used simultaneously, e.g., data = c(\"be\", \"es\", \"br21\", \"br20\").\n\n\n\nvars\nA character vector specifying the LIS/LWS variables to be loaded, e.g., vars = c(\"dhi\", \"region_c\", \"age\", \"relation\").\nIf no variables are specified, the entire dataset will be loaded.\nIf only household-level variables are selected (e.g., c(\"dhi\", \"region_c\")), the data will be loaded at the household level. However, if at least one person-level variable is included (e.g., \"age\"), the data will be loaded at the individual level.\nWhen selecting specific variables, note that some additional variables will be included by default. For clarity, run lissyrtools::key_vars_household_lis, lissyrtools::key_vars_person_lis, and their equivalents for LWS.\n\n\nfrom\nA numeric value representing the year (inclusive) after which the LIS/LWS datasets should be loaded.\n\n\nto\nA numeric value representing the year (inclusive) up to which the LIS/LWS datasets should be loaded.\n\n\nsubset\nA logical expression defining the criteria for subsetting the data. Observations for which the expression evaluates to TRUE are included in the subset.\n\n\nlws\nA logical value indicating whether to load LWS data. If TRUE, LWS data is loaded; otherwise (default: FALSE), LIS data is loaded instead. Note that this does not eliminate the need to set the ‘Project’ field accordingly in the LISSY remote system."
