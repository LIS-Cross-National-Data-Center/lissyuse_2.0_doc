In lissyuse.qmd, I started out writing what would be the documentation file. 
However, I guesss that the first page, the one where the webiste opens when loaded is 
always the contents of index.qmd, therefore I have copied all the things in lissyuse.qmd and 
started out doing the correction there. 

Nice repository:

Also wait a bit after commiting and pushing, to evaluate the changes in the link in 
github pages, sometimes it just takes a while .....
